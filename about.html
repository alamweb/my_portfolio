<br>
CAREER
<br>

<br>
It is my intention to pursue my career in the United States of America and to that end I am engaged
in studying to widen my range of skills in my chosen field. I am aware of the importance  of
adapting to the business ethos of the US where hard work is rewarded - both in team- work and through
individual enterprise and initiative.


<br>

<br>
INTERESTS
<br>

<br>
I have  a fairly wide range of interests.
Sport : Cricket and soccer  ( I note that there is a growing interest in parts of the USA in "European soccer").
  Ten-pin bowling is a great social sport and a very challenging one. Hiking and walking over a limited distances.
Entertainment;  Watching sport, movies and TV documentaries and comedies. Travel:  I have traveled to Japan, Malaysia,  Brunei, Singapore. In 2016 I crossed the USA on Amtrak from
 Boston to San Francisco ( with stop-overs in Albany, Chicago, Denver, Salt Lake City),  through to Seattle
where I was excited to visit Microsoft headquarters!, and then back east to Boston, spending several days
 in Glacier  National Park.
